# window.fetch polyfill

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/JakeChampion/fetch/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/JakeChampion/fetch)

The `fetch()` function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making
web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a subset
of the standard [Fetch specification][], enough to make `fetch` a viable
replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.

* If you believe you found a bug with how `fetch` behaves in your browser,
  please **don't open an issue in this repository** unless you are testing in
  an old version of a browser that doesn't support `window.fetch` natively.
  Make sure you read this _entire_ readme, especially the [Caveats](#caveats)
  section, as there's probably a known work-around for an issue you've found.
  This project is a _polyfill_, and since all modern browsers now implement the
  `fetch` function natively, **no code from this project** actually takes any
  effect there. See [Browser support](#browser-support) for detailed
  information.

* If you have trouble **making a request to another domain** (a different
  subdomain or port number also constitutes another domain), please familiarize
  yourself with all the intricacies and limitations of [CORS][] requests.
  Because CORS requires participation of the server by implementing specific
  HTTP response headers, it is often nontrivial to set up or debug. CORS is
  exclusively
