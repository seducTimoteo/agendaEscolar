## Getting Started

### Example Usage
<!--js
const merge = require('./')
-->

```js
const x = {
	foo: { bar: 3 },
	array: [{
		does: 'work',
		too: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
	}]
}

const y = {
	foo: { baz: 4 },
	quux: 5,
	array: [{
		does: 'work',
		too: [ 4, 5, 6 ]
	}, {
		really: 'yes'
	}]
}

const output = {
	foo: {
		bar: 3,
		baz: 4
	},
	array: [{
		does: 'work',
		too: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
	}, {
		does: 'work',
		too: [ 4, 5, 6 ]
	}, {
		really: 'yes'
	}],
	quux: 5
}

merge(x, y) // => output
```


### Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```sh
npm install deepmerge
```

deepmerge can be used directly in the browser without the use of package managers/bundlers as well:  [UMD version from unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/deepmerge/dist/umd.js).


### Include

deepmerge exposes a CommonJS entry point:

```
const merge = require('deepmerge')
```

The ESM entry point was dropped due to a [Webpack bug](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6584).

# API


## `merge(x, y, [options])`

Merge two objects `x` and `y` deeply, returning a new merged object with the
elements from both `x` and `y`.

If an element at the same key is present for both `x` and `y`, the value from
`y` will appear in the result.

Merging creates a new object, so that neither `x` or `y` is modified.

**Note:** By default, arrays are merged by concatenating them.

## `merge.all(arrayOfObjects, [options])`
